            <div class="intro-copy">
                <p>Most venture funds wait until startups have proven traction, competing with dozens of other investors for the same deals. We invest earlier—at the precise moment when exceptional founders graduate from the world's top accelerators and venture studios. This gives us first access to companies that have been rigorously vetted, operationally supported, and set up for success, but haven't yet hit the traditional VC radar.</p>
                <p>Our approach combines the upside of early-stage investing with the risk reduction of institutional validation. We don't discover startups in the wild—we partner with the organizations that build them.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Timing Advantage</h2>
            <div class="intro-copy">
                <p>Traditional VCs compete for the same deals at the same time. By the time a startup appears on their radar, valuations have climbed and competition is fierce. We invest months or even years earlier—when founders are still emerging from structured programs, before the feeding frenzy begins.</p>
            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="takeaway-copy">
                <p>This timing advantage isn't just about lower valuations. It's about relationship primacy. When we invest, we become the founding investor—the one founders remember, trust, and turn to first. That relationship compounds throughout the company's lifecycle, giving us access to follow-on rounds, insider information, and referrals to their founder networks.</p>

            <div class="intro-copy">
                <p>Most seed-stage investors write checks and hope for the best. We invest in companies that have already received months of hands-on support from expert operators—legal setup, financial modeling, customer discovery, go-to-market strategy, and more. Our ecosystem partners do the heavy lifting; we capture the value.</p>

                <p>This force multiplier effect means our portfolio companies are better prepared, better connected, and better positioned to succeed than typical seed-stage startups. They've been through structured validation. They've been coached by operators who've seen thousands of startups. They enter our portfolio with momentum, not just potential.</p>

                <p>Over the past decade, the venture-building industry has professionalized. What started as scattered experiments in startup creation has evolved into a global infrastructure of proven programs with track records, methodologies, and alumni networks.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.5rem; color: var(--color-primary);">The numbers tell the story:</h3>
                <ul class="why-now-list">
                    <li>1,000+ active accelerators and venture studios globally</li>
                    <li>$50B+ deployed through structured venture-building programs since 2010</li>
                    <li>30%+ of unicorns went through accelerators or incubation programs</li>
                    <li>Accelerator-backed companies raise follow-on funding at 2-3x the rate of non-accelerated peers</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;"><strong>But there's a gap:</strong> Most of these programs lack dedicated follow-on capital vehicles. Their graduates either struggle to raise traditional seed rounds or get picked off by opportunistic investors who didn't contribute to their development.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>We fill that gap.</strong> By providing patient, founder-friendly capital to the best companies emerging from the best programs, we capture deal flow that traditional VCs miss—and we do it with structural advantages they can't replicate.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 500;">The ecosystem is mature. The infrastructure is proven. The timing is perfect.</p>

Unlike traditional VCs who parachute in at demo day, Paul, Jillian, and Steve are true partners—they attend our programs, mentor our founders, and provide patient capital when timing is right. They've invested in eight of our graduates, and every one of them says VBF was the easiest, most founder-friendly fundraising experience they've had."</div>

VBF has built a proprietary pipeline that most institutional investors simply can't access. The combination of early entry, ecosystem validation, and systematic sourcing gives this fund a differentiated risk-return profile. It's one of the few early-stage funds where I feel confident in the repeatability of the strategy."</div>

                            <p>Steve is one of the most respected operators in the accelerator and venture-building world.

                            <p>He has coached hundreds of founders and venture leaders, designed programs that have supported companies through millions in follow-on capital, and shaped how innovation organizations measure success.

                            <p>Steve's gift is spotting teams with coachability, grit, and execution capacity long before traditional investors can. As LPs at First Round often say, "early is a phase, not a stage," and Steve has spent the last decade working in that exact phase.
